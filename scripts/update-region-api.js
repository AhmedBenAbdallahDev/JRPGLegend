REGION FIELD UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS

The region field has been successfully added to the database as a nullable TEXT field.
Here's how to update your API and frontend code:

1. API Routes:
   - In src/app/api/games/route.js, ensure the POST handler accepts null/empty region values
   - Example code: region: data.region || null

2. GameForm Component:
   - In src/components/GameForm.jsx, initialize region as empty string
   - Add a "Not specified" option in the region dropdown

3. GameImage Component:
   - In src/components/GameImage.jsx, handle null/empty region values:
   - If region is null/empty, default to 'us' for searches
   - Use appropriate region values for jp/eu regions

The database is now correctly structured to handle null/empty region values.
Any games with a null region will work fine - the application code just needs
to handle these values appropriately.
